## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

I have created a counter to count the number of moves made by player and timer to know the duration of a play.
Also I created shuffles cards when page is refreshed.
I have created effects to cards when they match and are unmatched.
I have created a pop-up modal when player wins game.
